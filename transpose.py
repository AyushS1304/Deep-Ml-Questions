# #Transpose of a Matrix
# Easy
# Linear Algebra


# Write a Python function that computes the transpose of a given 2D matrix. The transpose of a matrix is formed by turning its rows into columns and columns into rows. For an mÃn matrix, the transpose will be an nÃm matrix.

# Example:
# Input:
# a = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
# Output:
# [[1, 4], [2, 5], [3, 6]]
# Reasoning:
# The input is a 2×3 matrix. The transpose swaps rows and columns: the first row [1, 2, 3] becomes the first column, and the second row [4, 5, 6] becomes the second column, resulting in a 3×2 matrix.

# Solution
#using "zip" to iterate through the rows of the matrix and create new lists for each column, effectively transposing the matrix. The function constructs the transposed matrix by collecting the elements from each row into new lists that represent the columns of the original matrix.
